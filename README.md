# Project Overview

In this project you are given a web-based application that reads RSS feeds. The original developer of this application clearly saw the value in testing, they've already included [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/) and even started writing their first test suite! Unfortunately, they decided to move on to start their own company and we're now left with an application with an incomplete test suite. That's where you come in.


## What did I learn?

I was already very familiar with the concept of unit testing due to my current job doing server-side development.  What I learned was how to use Jasmine to use those same concepts.

# Running the application

To run the application, just open index.html in any modern Web browser
